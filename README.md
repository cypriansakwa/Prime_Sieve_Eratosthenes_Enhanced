This Rust program searches all prime numbers within a certain range by utilizing the 'num-bigint' crate for huge integers and the 'rayon' crate for parallel processing.

The software checks a set of huge numbers to see which are prime. It uses the 'num-bigint' package to handle arbitrarily large numbers and 'rayon' for efficient parallel processing.
